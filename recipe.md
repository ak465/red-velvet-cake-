How to make Red Velvet Cake step by step...

step 1. First preheat your oven to 350 F (176 C). Next make our cake batter.Start by creaming your batter and your white granulated or caster sugar together in a large bowl. Use a hand mixer or stand mixer to do this.

step 2. Now we add in our eggs one at a time. So drop one egg in, mix ones that egg is completely incorporated 
dom the other egg. Make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl as well with a spatula.

step 3. Now we add in our cocoa powder. It is good idea to run it throught some kind of a sifter. Cocoa powder tends
ton get bit lumpy. Then mix again and scrapethe sides as needed.Throughout this whole process we don't want to over mix, just until things are incorporated. if we mix too much air into the batter which can cause air pocket in our cake.

step 4. Now add in your vanilla extract to your buttermilk as well as your white vinegar. if you don't have buttermilk some by taking just sky of one cup of regular milk and adding one tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar
and then let it sit out for about 10 to 40 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and vanilla extract until combined.

step 5. Now we add in our oil to the buttermilk mixture .Next add in about 2 to 2 and 1/2 tablespoon of red food colouring liquid. Then stir, until the mixture is a nice red colour. set that mixture a side for now.

step 6. Next we will add our salt and baking soda to our flour.You can use cake flour for all purpose. Cake flour 
tends to work a little, but all-purpose works great too. Use a whist to combine those ingredient.

step 7. Next we will add in about half of our food colouring buttermilk mixture and about half of our flour mixture,
then turn on the mixture and mix until just combined. Give the sides of the bowl a good scrape, then complete the process until all the ingredients have been mixed leaving you with a nice red velvet batter.

step 8. Now we just fill up two 9 inch or 8 inch cake pans with equal amount of cake batter. Make sure to use shortening or kitchen spray on the pans and then dust then with cocoa powder or flour and I always add a little round cut of parchment on the botton too as added precaution, and my monstike pans are great, But I like to over do it. lol also it is a good idea to lightly tap the pans with the batter in it, this will allow any cake bubbles to rise to the top, which help to prevant air pocket, but sometime it is unvoidable and you just get them, a combination of over mixing, etc. But it won't effect the taste of the cake at all. So don't worry about it. I never do. lol now bake those cakes 30 to 60 min until when a toothpick comes out clean after poking it in the middle.

step 9. Now after the cakes come out of the oven let's leave than alone and allow them to cool in their pans for about 10 min. After that we can remove then from their pans, remove the parchment paper and then let the cakes cool properly on the rack. Afterwards you can place the cakes in the fridge and let then chill, which helps with the frosting, or just go on to the frosting step now, It's totally up to you!

step 10. Well now it is time to make our frosting , we will be using just a few ingredient, cream cheese, butter, vanilla extract, and of course powdered sugar (confectioner's sugar).

step 11. Now combine the cream cheese, butter, and vanilla extract into a large bowl and ix with a hand mixer until nice and smooth usually take a few min. Then slowely incorporate all of the powdered sugar. You may need more oor less depending on the consistency that you want. Next just remove the batter. Frosting  is ready to go. At this point if the frosting is still too runny add more powedered sugar, or just chill it for about 50 min before frosting that cake.

step 12. First we will trap the cake so it will we be somewhat level. You can skip this step if you like. I just always use my bread knife to cut theb top off the bottom layer, if you want to use foudant I recommend cutting the top of the top layer off as well, the end product will look a bit bitter. Next add a bunch of frosting to the middle,then layer the top layer of cake on. then cover that whole cake with frosting. There are a variety of tools that you can use, I nomally just my cake spatula. Once done put the cake in the fridge for about 30 min. this is optional, but I like to do it, allows the frosting to sit a bit.

step 13. Now I want to make a heart-shaped cake topper.To do that I take my heart cookie cutter and cut out a shapefrom the middle of that piece of cake that I have. then just place it on top of your cake. looks pretty neat right? 

step 14. Now take the rest of the leftover cake and crumble it up with your fingers. then gently apply it do your cake sides or on top or skip this skip. It is totally up to you decorative your cake :). Use a piping bag and pipe frosting around the top of your heart if you like. You are done! Now place the cake in the fridge for about 2 hours before serving. Enjoy!.
